Catalog container, catalog and link details
=======================================================================
This formatting system is used as the traditional logic for tables
    in HTML is not suitible for constant updates due to the central 
    unit of organization being rows instead of columns. Therefore the
    catalog and catalog container system focuses on columns such that
    categorizing links is made easy.
@Catalog container - A "table", not a literal HTMl table.
@Catalog - A column within the "table" that has two elements related
    to it, the catalog-title and catalog-list.
@Catalog-title - A label for the category of item being put into the
    catalog.
@Catalog-list - A collection of items that make up the catalog, the
    items inside are links. This class was created to ensure control over the
    styling of a link inside of the catalog system. It is the 
    fundamental unit of the catalog.
